# COS 135 Final Project: Guess The Country

## Description
This program is a country guessing game. It loads countries and their hints from continent text files (`africa.txt`, `asia.txt`, etc.), randomly selects a country, and presents three hints for the user to guess the country. The menu allows launching the game, viewing credits, or exiting.

The "something not explicitly taught in class" is text colorization.

How to Run:
   make clean
   make
   ./guess_country

   Notes: While making this I was going to do a lot more but ran out of time, I was going to add an "add a country" feature but couldn't make it. So it isn't a fully complete product (which would make me an average Ubisoft dev), but I did add a bit of the required information. I messed up on Looping through an array by incrementing/decrementing a pointer but still I tried my best to cover most needed objectives for the project.
